2. Open the `.env` file in the root of this directory and fill out the Azure Storage account credentials
3. Run `npm install` within the root of this directory, using your terminal program
4. Open `uploadBlob.js` in your favourite code editor and change the `device` property in the webcam options to match the string name of your own webcam.
